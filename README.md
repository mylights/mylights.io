### What is Mylights? 

Mylights is a cloud-based video tagging application for coaches, players and parents to tag and share the moments that matter. It's designed for simplicity and can tag any YouTube or Boxcast video capable of being embedded.

Create multiple video highlight lists from a single source video and share the clips through social media. Players, family and more can create their own highlight playlists from that same source video.
